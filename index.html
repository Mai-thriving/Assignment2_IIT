<p>After looking at the Burning Glass Data, I can see that I still lack some essential technical skills required for my ideal job. However, my opinion about the ideal job does not change, as I believe that even if I switch to another job, or maybe another field of work, these skills still play an important role to help me accomplish my tasks easier and faster in this digital world.</p>

  <h1><p class="impact"> 4. IT WORK </p></h1>
</div>

  <p>
    <br> We are fortunate to have a chance to interview an IT professional, Mr. Kai, currently a project manager for a Singapore technology company. His company focuses mainly on AI-combined technology products. The company completed three major projects and launched in Silicon Valley two years ago, their current partner is Netflix and Verkada. Currently, the company is developing two AI projects in Vietnam to serve education primarily. The clients of these two platforms are the data scientists and developers.
    <br> His daily jobs are to manage and communicate with a lot of people. Ten people are working under his command, including three frontends, three backends, two mobile developers, and two product developments. Besides, he has to work with a UX, UI design team as outsourcing. Moreover, due to the work nature of a project manager, he always has to talk, find out the need for market and customer, and then sum up all of that travel to visualize and give the product features. For the company's current products, the data scientist, the developers, and the business development of companies with management problems and processing data will be the main subject to which he has to talk every day.
    <br> Kai said he spent most of his time at the meetings. He often comes to the company at 8 am every morning. The first thing he does is track everyone's work through a specialized management software built by his company. Then Kai does the scrum with the team every 8:30 am. Kai will arrange a time to call the facetime meeting with the clients and the companies to learn about their difficulties and needs. His assistant arranged the list he had to call that day, normally one day, he'd call about two or three calls. In addition to meeting with customers, he uses the time to design features and learn about the technologies used to build these features. He was also a developer as a student, so understanding the technology inside a product was not too difficult. After having a complete understanding and design, Kai will work with his team's CTO on what he just found out. They will discuss with each other to make a final decision for new features. He spent time watching the day reports of everyone in the team to keep track of their work progress while also assigning tasks for the team tomorrow.
    <br> Kai said that his position is facing a lot of difficulties. But the biggest difficulty for him is to communicate with everyone on the team. Kai is a Singaporean who lives in Vietnam. He has to communicate with the team in English. All the staff on the team are Vietnamese. There are times when they can't get to know each other, or the team doesn't understand 100% of his requests that he wants them to do. He has always wanted to discuss and listen to everyone's opinions about the product, but sometimes he feels they don't share or sloth out their opinions because they don't know how to play it in English.

  <b>I. Blockchain & Cryptocurrencies </b>
</h2>
</div>

<h3><b><i>i. Definition, current state, and trends </b></i></h3>

<h4><b><u>a) Definition</u></b></h4>
<p>
  <br> Blockchain is a data structure using cryptographic techniques and is managed by a peer-to-peer community where everybody, each acting as a node in this chain, must together reach an agreement in validating and creating new transactions which will be stored in a new block. The data stored in these blocks also cannot be changed without the consensus of this whole distributed network, thus it will prevent hackers from modifying the information stored here (Chowdhury 2019).
  <br> Cryptocurrencies are a form of virtual asset which is only created limitedly, and the most well-known type of cryptocurrencies is Bitcoin, utilizing blockchain to store its value (similar to traditional assets such as gold, stocks or real estate). The prices of cryptocurrencies are determined by their supply and demand in the market. Cryptocurrencies can be used in transactions via the Internet, equally to traditional currencies, and it can be sent directly from the account of one to another, which means there is no intermediary required to authorize these transactions (Grabowski 2019).
</p>

<h4><b><u>b) Current state</u></b></h4>
<h5>
  <u>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>Applications</li>
    </ul>
  </u>
</h5>
<p>
  <br> The most prevalent application of blockchain nowadays is in the financial system. The most well-known application of blockchain, as aforementioned, is cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies, until now, have not been made to be legal in every jurisdiction around the world, since policy makers are still afraid of their risks of being used in illegal transactions for money laundering and terrorism (Library of Congress 2018).
  <br> Nevertheless, it is refutable that blockchain can help facilitate transactions of stocks, bonds, and derivatives in the financial markets. It provides digital payments and means of exchange cryptocurrencies such as Wirex, an e-wallet that supports the payment and exchange of both traditional and cryptocurrencies. Recently, Mastercard, a prominent payment service company has joined hands with Wirex to promote this new payment method via digital currencies, according to Browne 2020.
  <br> Blockchain is also used in the prediction marketplace system, where blockchain acts as an advisor to assist investors in predicting the future state of the market, and henceforth they can rely on these advice to trade shares, earn interest on market products such as oil, gas, or traditional currencies. The relevant examples here are Augur and Bitshares, both are digital tokens that apply PMS for users to trade based on the outcomes of future events (Casino et al. 2019).
  <br> Also, thanks to the transparency that blockchain brings to users, it has helped reduce costs to produce financial reports and financial auditing (Casino et al. 2019).
  <br> This technology is utilized in integrity verification as well, in which the system will store the data about lifetime information and transactions related to the formation of a product or a service: Blockchain has already been deployed for intellectual property protection (Ex: Mediachain, a database which helps creators claim and save their intellectual property rights) and for identity management (Ex: Shocard, a company which provides solutions to ease the complexity in “Know your customer”) (Casino et al. 2019).
  <br> Another field in which blockchain is nurturing is IoT, Internet of Things. Blockchain provides a way to secure data exchanged between interconnected devices, enhance their synchronization and their efficiency when operating in a decentralized and automated network (Ex: Blockpass, an application powered by blockchain technology to simplify the process of verification for humans, objects and connected devices when using different applications) (Jain 2018 & Chain of Things n.d.)
  <br> In businesses, many crowdfunding organizations have been seen to apply blockchain technology. The case of Swarm, Lighthouse and bitFyler can be mentioned here where they are all using blockchain to build their platforms (Casino et al. 2019). Another sector which is witnessing the rapid growth of blockchain is supply chain management, as the technology helps expand the value chains by developing trust between stakeholders, detecting counterfeit products, reducing paper works and the intervention of intermediaries.
  <br> The solution provided by Riddle & Code to enhance the security in logistics illustrated in Figure 1 can best describe how blockchain can guarantee the transparency and information security in this field:
  <div class="a">

</p>

<h5>
  <u>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>Drawbacks</li>
    </ul>
  </u>
</h5>

<p>
  <br> Despite the fact that more and more people are aware of the usefulness of blockchain and apply it in their businesses, it is still far from perfect for blockchain to be widely used since it remains several issues which hinder the way entrepreneurs can deploy this technology on a large scale.
  <br> The first problem of blockchain is latency: each transaction of Bitcoin takes several minutes to process, due to the processing of each block and the security checks to eliminate double-spend attack, while it takes much more slower for traditional processing system of VISA to validate a transaction (Casino et al. 2019).
  <br> The second problem relates to the intensive power consumption that blockchain requires for the system to keep verifying transactions, since it costs about 15 million USD/day for mining Bitcoin (Krishnan et al. 2020). This leads to massive expenses to deploy and to maintain the capacity for the growing users, especially for small and medium enterprises (Golosova & Romanovs 2018).
  <br> The third problem of blockchain is scalability: when more nodes are added, the verification time will increase, and new blocks will have to be waiting for being validated. Notwithstanding, this issue can be tackled by Raiden Network Protocol, by which global consensus is not necessary because only the last on-chain transaction between each entity is charged a fee, other transactions can occur off-chain and require no fees. A network of payment channels between different entities can be established to utilize the inherent payment networks created so that the new channel does not have to be formed and thus reduces costs of using blockchain (Krishnan et al. 2020).
</p>

<h4><b><u>b) Trend</u></b></h4>
<p>
  <br> Giving such obstacles, blockchain is still believed to keep emerging in certain sectors. Insurance is a potential field for this technology to develop, as blockchain can help ease the process of validating claims in different types of insurance (Prabhakar et al. 2017).
  <br> Regarding the field of governance, blockchain-based applications can ease the process of managing public records as well as mitigating the risk of corruption and bureaucracy in the context of smart city through electronic voting and simplified procedure of taxation, claiming patent, and business registration.
  <br> With respect to the healthcare system, blockchain can be used to assure data security in managing healthcare records of patients (Casino et al. 2019).
  <br> With reference to education, blockchain can provide transparency in handling educational records to promote more equitable rewards (Casino et al. 2019).
  <br> Also, in businesses, there is still space for blockchain to evolve through ensuring illegal information disclosures through cross-organizational management and facilitating the selection process, increase the credential in applicant’s background, and ease the payroll procedure in human resources management (Wiles 2019).
</p>

<h3><b><i>ii. Social impact</i></b></h3>
<p>
  <br> It is manifestly true that blockchain was born to promote decentralization in many fields such as the Internet and many public sectors which are currently being conquered by Internet Service Providers, the governments and other tech giants. With the ubiquity of blockchain in the future, corruption and monopoly may be reduced (Al-Saqaf & Seidler 2017).
  <br> Besides, companies which are acting as intermediaries in transactions will most likely be negatively affected as blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies will foster the peer-to-peer exchange, allowing direct interaction between sellers and consumers without the need of their intervention (Ertz & Boily 2019).
  <br> The way an organization is managed will also be changed: major decisions can be carried out without the involvement of the CEO by a new governance system called decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), powered by Ethereum, where the votes of the members in the organization can be updated real-time through smart contracts and therefore enables every member to express their opinions about certain issues in the organization (Lee 2019).
  <br> In the world of blockchain, the money supply will no longer be adjusted by the central bank, as there will be more than one type of currency in a country and the interest rate of each currency will rather be determined by its degree of risk than deliberate plan of the central bank (Anderson 2019).
  <br> It should also be mentioned that thanks to blockchain and cryptocurrencies, workers, especially those who are working for multinational corporations, will get paid more quickly and receive relatively higher wage as they can avoid the imbalance in exchange rate between different countries as well as the cumbersome paper works issued by the intermediary banks (Hartog 2019).
</p>

<h3><b><i>iii. Personal impact </i></b></h3>
<p>
  <br> A world where no cash will be needed and there will also be no need for money exchange when travelling to a foreign country is visible when cryptocurrencies prevail. In such a world, when I rent a house, I will only have to pay a required number of crypto-tokens, and the owner will send me a key to unlock the smart electric locks via a cryptographically signed message to unlock the door. The paper works relating to money transfer with the involvement of banks will be eliminated (Christidis & Devestsikiotis 2016).
  <br> In the world dominated by block chain and IoT, if my car is low in fuel, it will automatically choose the nearest gas station for me to drive there and fill the petrol. The costs will be directly charged in my e-wallet since everything I own is linked to it. Also, if I am to lend the motorbike for my friend or my brother, they cannot use my e-wallet to fill up the tank because this system is customizable, and even in the case that I allow them to use my e-wallet, I can still track how much money they have used through the history transactions which cannot be made to change.
  <br> Also, my mother will not have to bother about prices and quality of goods when going to the market anymore: an app will calculate the best prices in every local groceries in the city, send the lists of goods she has chosen before to the retailers and they will send everything she needs to our home, and the bills will be automatically settled in my e-wallet (Huckle et al. 2016).
